&lt;&lt;ons p(C-Moon is a programming language developed by *wwoa1* the know it all)>>

consist of me tryin to make sometin for you to use so you can save some time :D

it changes the names of stuff like (funtions) and (varriables) and makes them suupppeerrr easy to type out so you wont need any auto fill apps anymore ;)

functions are now just the letter "F" and varriables are just the letter "V" and printing something is done by saying "P" just to name a few
